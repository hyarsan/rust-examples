# Rust examples

Containins several examples of the usage of libnx and Rust for **devKitPro + Rust** homebrew development.

## Building

Install Rust and prepare the environment according to [our guide](https://github.com/rusty-horizon/setup-guide).

Then, just get into the project's directory and run `build.sh` for building, or `clean.sh` for cleaning.

You can always run `build-all.sh` on root to build all the examples, or projects located inside the directory.
